##### About Hempcoin
The HempCoin ($THC) was one of the first 30 cryptocurrencies founded in 2014. We are building a supply tracking platform for the Agricultural Industry spotlighting Hemp in its first iteration. Growers will be able to know what they are doing per day/week/harvest and have real time forecasting/analytics on a mobile device.

We like to extend our hands in cooperation, as we bring many capabilities to the table. For instance accepting cryptocurrency payments in 75+ coins for 0% fees both online and instore, then trading those into an fiat currency globally (dollars, pounds, pesos, rubles, yen) at a .3% fee
