##### About Tokel Platform
Tokel is a dedicated token and non-fungible token (NFT) platform.

###### What is Tokel?
Tokel is an open-source, dedicated, token & non-fungible token (NFT) platform. The Tokel platform provides end-to-end token solutions to creators, businesses and projects alike. Utilizing and developing on existing Komodo technologies, Tokel offers an array of layer 1 blockchain features, including UTXO based, on-chain token creation, management and decentralized trading functions (tokenDEX & NFT marketplace). The Tokel all-in-one superlite application aims to showcase all of these features using Komodo nSPV technology and will include a coin wallet, token wallet, token explorer, tokenDEX, NFT marketplace, and a simple to use token creation tool.

###### Vision
The Tokel Platform aims to be the best decentralized token platform on offer. The Tokel Platform will build a solid foundation, using existing Komodo Technologies, for token projects to launch and succeed from. This will be done through the creation of end-to-end token solutions for fixed supply and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This includes everything from the blockchain architecture, the information, assistance and open-sourced applications for projects and businesses looking to capitalize on token economics or token applications. Projects will be able to use streamlined token creation processes, have token explorer and wallet integrations, immediately trade on the decentralized exchange and utilize the NFT marketplace.

###### Features
Tokel ($TKL) is the currency at the center of the Tokel ecosystem.
